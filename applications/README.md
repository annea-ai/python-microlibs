============

Contains runnable applications

# Docker
Applications are by default run using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Applications are runnable with `docker-compose up`, if you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

# Dependencies
If your app depends on microlib dependencies you need to provide then via a [local pip server](../README.md#local-pypi-server)
